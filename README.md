## About
Calling all Minecraft-playing Death Note fans! This Minecraft plugin adds the infamous notebook from the popular anime to your Bukkit / Spigot / Paper server, allowing you to bestow your divine judgment upon other players.

Death Note is a popular Japanese anime in which a mysterious notebook holds the power to kill anyone in the world, simply by writing down a person's name. This plugin brings the Death Note notebook to Minecraft, placing its incredible power to kill in the palm of your hand.

## How to Use
To use the Death Note, simply type the username of any online player on the first page of the notebook. Then, as according to the rules of the Death Note, that player will die within 40 seconds. No kidding.

Once a player's life has been taken by a Death Note, their username will be added to the note's list of victims. If you plan on having a run-in with L, Near, or any members of the Task Force, you'll need to take this into consideration.
